        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            This application calculates the CO2 emissions for gas and electric vehicles based on the provided inputs. For gas
            vehicles, it uses the CO2 emissions per gallon of the selected fuel type and divides it by the miles per gallon of
            the vehicle. For electric vehicles, it takes the Watt hours of the battery, multiplies it by the CO2 per Watt hour
            figure for lithium batteries, divides this figure by the number of miles per charge, and then divides it again by
            the number of charges before battery replacement. This calculator also uses United States National Averages to add 
            in the CO2 Produced from the electricity that is needed to make the vehicle operate. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The "Convert Units" button allows you to switch between miles and kilometers. When this button is pressed, all text
            referencing miles is changed to KMH and all calculations are adjusted accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
            The "Calculate" button performs the calculations and displays the results in KG of CO2 produced per mile driven for
            both gas and electric vehicles.

            <p>
                This calculator is designed to allow someone to compare if purchasing an additional Environmentally friendly Vehicle makes the environmental sense.\
                 This is not to be used to compare two new vehicle to each other as it does not factor in the impact on the environment production of the Fossil fuel driven vehicle has. There are many 
                other factors that are to be taken into account such as how clean is energy generation. This does also not account for the impact on the environment production of the electric vehicles frame and supporting components

                How to find Battery size Information: 
                To calculate battery capacity, look for certain keywords such as Volts(V), and Amp Hours (Ah), Watt Hours (Wh) amd Kilo-Watt Hours (KWh)
                If you find Kilo-Watt Hours please convert the value by 1000 and enter it in the battery size box EX: 20 KWh -> 20,000 Wh
                if you find Watt Hours, enter that value for battery size 
                if you Get Volts and Amp hours, multiply both values together: EX: 48V and 26 Ah -> 48 * 26 -> 1248 Wh 
                Remember google is your friend, and you can most of the time find the value just by searching for the model of the vehicle followed by battery capacity
